Final Project:
  Galaga-type video game involving 5 enemies and one player. The player and enemies both shoot at each other and if either is hit they are
  removed from the game. The controls for the player are 'A' which moves the player to the left; 'D' which moves the player to the right;
  'Q' which quits the game; and 'Spacebar' which makes the user fire a bullet from his location. The user wins the game if all of the 
  enemies are removed from the game.
  
Design:
  The program was designed in Python using the graphics.py package from Zelle.
